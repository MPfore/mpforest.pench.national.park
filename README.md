Pench National Park


About Pench National Park
Pench Tiger Reserve, designated after the pristine Pench River, is nestled in the Madhya Pradesh districts of Chhindwara and Seoni, which adjoin the state of Maharashtra.

The Pench River runs directly through the park's heart. It runs north to south, separating the reserve into proportionate eastern and western halves. Since it was designated as a tiger reserve later in 1992, the area is now often known as Pench National Park.

Pench Tiger Reserve is both Madhya Pradesh's and Maharashtra's pride. Because of its unusual location, it has been accessible from both states since entry gates open. The park houses not only wildlife but also mankind. Ten communities surround the park, with one inside Fulzari and the other nine on the outskirts.

Though Pench National Park appears to be a recreation of the classic story, it is much more. Flora species found in the Pench Tiger Reserve include Mahua, White Kulu, Salai, Saja, Bijiyasal, Dhaora, Amaltas, and many more. Aside from trees, the park contains meadows, shrubs, and saplings.


Entry Gates Of Indira Priyadarshini Pench National Park
The forest in Madhya Pradesh is separated into Core Zones and Buffer Zones. Among these entrance gates are:

    • Number of Core Zones - 03 [ Turia Gate, Karmajheri Gate, Jamtara Gate ]
    • Number of Buffer Zones - 03 [ Rukhad Buffer Zone, Khawasa Buffer Zone, Teliya Buffer Zone ]
    • Entry Gates Near Core Zones - 02 [ Khursapar Gate, Sillari Gate ]

    • Turia Gate
The Turia Gate in the Core Zone is the most well-known of all the gates. This zone has the highest concentration of Tiger Sightings. Turia gate is located on the boundary of Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra, near the NH7. Most resorts are positioned in this zone, located in the southern section of the forest.

    • Karmajheri Gate
This gate is less crowded and has limited lodging. Forest rest huts are also found here. Teak trees dominate this area of the forest.

    • Jamtara Gate
This park's third entrance gives only a tiny portion of the park to explore. Crossing across to other zones is possible from Chendia ghat.

    • Rukhad Buffer Zone
Because this is a hilly location, Rukhad also serves as a vital Tiger corridor for Pench and Kanha. During this interval, guests can go on a vehicle safari. This is more suitable for those staying near the Karmajhiri gate. Contact us to find out what plan will suit you best for Rukhad gate Booking.

    • Teliya Buffer Zone
This recent buffer zone is known for its wolf encounters. Still, it is also known for its Black Panther/ Melanistic Leopard spottings. Aside from Leopard, the Teliya buffer provides excellent opportunities to see Barking Deer, Chowsingha, and Blue-Bull Antelope.

    • Khawasa Buffer Zone
This buffer is also renowned as the Wolf Sanctuary, and it is possible to go on a night safari in this region. The region is primarily an open forested forest, which creatures like wolves, foxes, porcupines, and owls appreciate. When staying towards the Turia gate, this is a preferable approach. When you get in touch with us, we can help you find the suitable Khawasa Booking for your needs.

    • Khursapar Gate
Khursapar, located 12 kilometers from Khawasa and 30 kilometers from Turia, is another renowned safari zone of Pench National Park on the Maharashtra side. It is the most popular zone for day visitors since the odds of seeing wild predators in their native habitats are plentiful in this zone. We can assist you in finding the suitable Khawasa Booking based on your needs when contacting us.

    • Sillari Gate
This gate is 30 kilometers away from the Turia gate. The entire rainforest is stunning, with a diverse range of habitats. Open grassy sections, heavily forested patches, rocky and bushy hotfixes, extensive bamboo patches, dry open mountainous landscapes, and freshwater waterways can all be found. At this gate, there are extremely few basic lodging alternatives. Our team of experts will assist you in finding the suitable Pench Sillari Gate Booking for your needs when you get in touch with us.

Escape Life For A Little While At Pench!
Pench National Park is a prominent Madhya Pradesh tourist spot. The most fundamental reason for its appeal is the sight of an endangered beast. This park rose to prominence during the British Raj; however, it was never used for hunting by the Ruling Families.

The expanding demography of tourist visitors in Pench National Park is evidence of the curiosity that leads tourists to this tiger reserve to see how the beast is now surviving in such small numbers and what attempts are being made to protect the Tigers from poachers. It was only by the continual efforts of local inhabitants that the reserves could be saved. With the vision of Mrs. Indira Gandhi, the late Prime Minister of India, this park could obtain a safe canopy of Conservation for protecting the species.

So, what else are you waiting for? Now is the time to plan your next trip to Indira Priyadarshini Pench National Park for an extraordinary getaway! While you're here, lodge at Pench and experience the grandeur of nature in the existence of wild animals in Madhya Pradesh.
